### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I'm a Full Stack Developer, mainly working with Python/Django, PHP, React & Docker. I consider myself startup-oriented as I enjoy working on hard problems, thinking in terms of Systems Desing and building new products with a focus on long-term success.

ðŸŒ± As a freelancer, I'm offering solutions for Web Applications, APIs and integrations to companies and to small to medium-sized businesses, mostly customer services related with a focus on scalability and workflow automation.

ðŸ‘¯ Worked at [SolutionistXR](https://solutionist.gr/) as a Full Stack Developer.

ðŸ”­ Worked at [@InnovationHive](https://github.com/InnovationHive) as a Developer for EU-Funded Projects
